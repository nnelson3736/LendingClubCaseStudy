# Lending Club Case Study
> This is a case study to analyse and find out the variables which can help us identify the applicants who have a tendency to default of their loans. This way we can reduce the loss to the lending club which is incurred by all the loans which are Charged Off because the applicant failed to pay back the loan.

## Dataset
- The original Dataset was very large with 111 variables
- for better understanding we cleaned the data and reduced the number of variables to 13

- We also removed the variables which contained invalid or null values
